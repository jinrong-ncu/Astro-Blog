# Hello 刘金荣

This is a test post to verify the **Vibe Coding** aesthetic. We are looking for:

1.  **Minimalism**: Clean lines, ample whitespace.
2.  **Typography**: Excellent readability with `Inter`.
3.  **Performance**: Blazing fast load times with Astro.

## The Stack

- **Astro**: The web framework for content-driven websites.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first CSS framework (CSS variables only).
- **React**: For interactive islands.

```tsx
// Example Component
export default function Counter() {
  return <button>Click me</button>;
}
```

## Dark Mode Test

This section tests the dark mode toggle. The code block above should remain dark even in light mode, as per "Vercel-style" conventions.
